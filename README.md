Unmasking Dunning-Kruger Effect in Visual Reasoning & Judgment Mengyu Chen, Yijun Liu, and Emily Wall

IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG, Proc. IEEE VIS'24). 2024.
## Abstract
The Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) is a metacognitive phenomenon where low-skilled individuals tend to overestimate
their competence while high-skilled individuals tend to underestimate their competence. This effect has been observed in a number
of domains including humor, grammar, and logic. In this paper, we explore if and how DKE manifests in visual reasoning and
judgment tasks. Across two online user studies involving (1) a sliding puzzle game and (2) a scatterplot-based categorization task, we
demonstrate that individuals are susceptible to DKE in visual reasoning and judgment tasks: those who performed best underestimated
their performance, while bottom performers overestimated their performance. In addition, we contribute novel analyses that correlate
susceptibility of DKE with personality traits and user interactions. Our findings pave the way for novel modes of bias detection via
interaction patterns and establish promising directions towards interventions tailored to an individualâ€™s personality traits.
